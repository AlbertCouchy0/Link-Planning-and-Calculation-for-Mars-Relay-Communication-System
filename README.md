# Link Planning and Calculation for Mars Relay Communication System
### Project Description (English Version)

#### Project Background  
With the continuous development of deep-space exploration technology, Mars, as the planet most similar to Earth in the solar system, has become an important target for human space exploration. The Mars relay communication system is a key technology connecting Earth and Mars, and its performance directly affects the success or failure of deep-space exploration missions. This project aims to model, analyze, and calculate the links of the Mars relay communication system, assess link losses, explore frequency characteristics, and propose corresponding communication system design solutions. It provides theoretical support and practical guidance for the design and optimization of Mars communication systems.

#### Project Objectives  
1. Establish a link model for the Mars communication system, including the link between the Mars lander and the Mars orbiter, and the link between the Mars orbiter and the Earth ground station.
2. Analyze the main factors affecting the communication link, such as free-space loss, Martian dust, Martian clouds, Martian atmospheric absorption, Earth atmospheric rain attenuation, and solar scintillation loss.
3. Calculate the losses of the Mars lander-Mars orbiter communication link and the Mars orbiter-Earth station communication link, and analyze the loss variation patterns under different frequency bands.
4. Propose a communication system design solution, including optimization suggestions for antenna size, transmission power, and operating frequency.

#### Project Content  
1. **Link Modeling**  
   - The Mars communication system link consists of two segments: the link between the Mars lander and the Mars orbiter, and the link between the Mars orbiter and the Earth ground station.
   - The link between the Mars lander and the Mars orbiter is analyzed for loss factors, including free-space loss, Martian atmospheric absorption loss, Martian cloud attenuation, and Martian dust attenuation.
   - The link between the Mars orbiter and the Earth ground station is analyzed for loss factors, including free-space loss, Earth atmospheric rain attenuation, Earth atmospheric absorption loss, cloud attenuation, and solar scintillation loss.

2. **Link Loss Analysis and Calculation**  
   - **Mars Lander-Mars Orbiter Communication Link**: Calculate free-space loss, Martian atmospheric absorption loss, Martian cloud attenuation, and Martian dust attenuation, and derive the total loss.
   - **Mars Orbiter-Earth Station Communication Link**: Calculate free-space loss, Earth atmospheric rain attenuation, Earth atmospheric absorption loss, cloud attenuation, and solar scintillation loss, and derive the total loss.

3. **Frequency Characteristic Analysis**  
   - Analyze the loss characteristics of the Mars lander-Mars orbiter communication link in the UHF band (300MHz-3GHz) and derive the loss variation pattern with frequency.
   - Analyze the loss characteristics of the Mars orbiter-Earth station communication link in the X band (8-12GHz) and Ka band (26.5-40GHz) and derive the loss variation pattern with frequency.

4. **Communication System Design**  
   - Propose a link design solution for the Mars communication system based on the CCSDS standard, including optimization suggestions for antenna size, transmission power, and operating frequency.
   - Determine the minimum antenna size required to meet communication requirements through calculations and simulations, and analyze the impact of different transmission powers and operating frequencies on antenna size.

#### Project Outcomes  
1. Provide detailed loss analysis and frequency characteristic analysis of the Mars communication system links.
2. Propose an optimized design solution for the Mars communication system, providing theoretical basis and practical guidance for the actual design and optimization of communication systems.
3. Offer references for the design of communication systems in Mars exploration missions to ensure the reliability and efficiency of deep-space communications.
